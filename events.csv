","The metaverse is a concept of a persistent, online, 3D universe that combines multiple different virtual spaces. You can think of it as a future iteration of the internet. The metaverse will allow users to work, meet, game, and socialize together in these 3D spaces.

The metaverse isn’t fully in existence, but some platforms contain metaverse-like elements. Video games currently provide the closest metaverse experience on offer. Developers have pushed the boundaries of what a game is through hosting in-game events and creating virtual economies.

Although not required, cryptocurrencies can be a great fit for a metaverse. They allow for creating a digital economy with different types of utility tokens and virtual collectibles (NFTs). The metaverse would also benefit from the use of crypto wallets, such as Trust Wallet and MetaMask. Also, blockchain technology can provide transparent and reliable governance systems.

Blockchain, metaverse-like applications already exist and provide people with liveable incomes. Axie Infinity is one play-to-earn game that many users play to support their income. SecondLive and Decentraland are other examples of successfully mixing the blockchain world and virtual reality apps.

During this invitation-only networking event, we’ll include industry gurus in blockchain, crypto and gaming, XR to reimagine the future together.

"Governor's Mansion (G,M)",late nite celebration,"Governor's Mansion (G,M) is an exclusive event for the community to live like the Portuguese nobility of years past.

Decentralization is about coordinating many different people from different walks of life around a common goal. These governance systems only work with everyone's participation, but in turn allow the community to share all of the upside.

About Governor's Mansion (G,M)

Commonwealth organizes community events to reward active participation in governance. These events are strictly NO NETWORKING. We all deserve a night off to enjoy the progress we have made and get to know each other on a personal level.

There will be an open bar with special cocktails and mocktails. Additionally, we will have music provided by DJ Wagmi to keep the vibes flowing.

The guest list will be strictly enforced. In order to get off the waitlist you must be an active community member. Join commonwealth.im and link an email to get started with community governance!

About Commonwealth

Commonwealth is an all-in-one platform for DAOs, governance, and community management.
